# Lean Drive

> Google Drive clone in SvelteKit

This project follows [Theo's tutorial on building a Google Drive clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-hKSbzooAg).

However, I'm using a completely different stack (i.e. _Svelte, SvelteKit, Vercel, Supabase, Better Auth_ instead of _React, Next.js, Netlify, SingleStore, Clerk_), so I'm just learning **what** to do, and **how** to do it is entirely my own research.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Create UI and mock data
- [ ] Set up database and data model
- [ ] Add authentication
- [ ] Add file uploading

### Note from 01.02.2025

Just finished up connecting database, next steps:

- [ ] Update schema to show files and folders
- [ ] Manually insert examples
- [ ] Render them in the UI
- [ ] Push and make sure it all works
